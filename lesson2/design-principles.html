        <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
        <p>
          Visual hierarchy focuses on arranging elements to show their order of
          importance. Designers structure visual characteristics so users can
          understand information easily. By laying out elements strategically,
          designers influence users' perceptions and guide them to desired
          actions. For example, it is fairly universal that the symbol of three
          stacked horizontal lines represents a hidden menu that users can click
          or tap to access.

        <p>
          Chase's website before signing in has it's biggest products front and
          center because Chase knows that if you don't have a login already, you
          are a potential new customer who is linkely looking for a bank
          account, credit card, or mortgage.

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <p>
          Hick's Law states that users take longer to make a decision as the
          number of options increases. Take for example the Charles Schwab
          mobile site. With so many different routes to take, as a user I would
          likely feel overwhelmed with the ammount of links on their homepage.
          By nature of the services it provides, Schwab may not be able to
          easily compartmentalize it's services into large categories. However,
          if it had more finger friendly navigation it would have been a more
          pleasant experience.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/schwab-mobile.jpeg"
          alt="screenshot-of-Schwab-mobile-website"
        />
        <p>
          Since Schwab has so many options for investment accounts, they seek to
          funnel potential customers to the right page depending on the
          questions they answer. Where Chase assumes customers know who they are
          and what they offer, Schwab's design seeks to make a good first
          impression with a stranger.

        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <p>
          This is a guideline that proposes an image should be visually divided
          into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two
          equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional
          elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections. I
          looked for a website that best exemplified this rule and found
          Amazon's homepage to be a good example.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/amazon-mobile.jpeg"
          alt="screenshot-of-amazon-homepage"
        />
        <p>
          While the homepage isn't split evenly like the lines that show up on
          your phone's camera, the homepage is designed in such a way that there
          is an easily understandable symmetry to the website.
