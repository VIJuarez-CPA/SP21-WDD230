        <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
        <p>
          Visual hierarchy focuses on arranging elements to show their order of
          importance. Designers structure visual characteristics so users can
          understand information easily. By laying out elements strategically,
          designers influence users' perceptions and guide them to desired
          actions. For example, it is fairly universal that the symbol of three
          stacked horizontal lines represents a hidden menu that users can click
          or tap to access.

          Chase's website before signing in has it's biggest products front and
          center because Chase knows that if you don't have a login already, you
          are a potential new customer who is linkely looking for a bank
          account, credit card, or mortgage.
